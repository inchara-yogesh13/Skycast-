*DESCRIPTION*:
Skycast is a responsive, interactive web application that provides real-time weather information and forecasts worldwide. Inspired by Google Weather’s clean and minimal interface, it presents temperature, weather conditions, humidity, wind speed, and “feels like” temperature in an intuitive, visually appealing design.
Users can search for any city globally or use auto-location to instantly receive weather updates for their current location. Dynamic weather icons and changing background colors reflect real-time conditions such as clear skies, clouds, rain, snow, thunderstorms, or mist, enhancing both usability and aesthetics. The forecast section displays daily weather snapshots in a scrollable format, enabling users to plan ahead efficiently.
Skycast is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, leveraging OpenWeatherMap API for live weather data. The project includes asynchronous data fetching (AJAX / Fetch API), geolocation integration, dynamic DOM manipulation, error handling, and responsive, mobile-first design. Loader animations and informative error messages enhance user experience, while clean CSS gradients and weather-based backgrounds create a modern, polished interface.
Optimized for multiple devices, Skycast demonstrates practical skills in frontend development, API integration, and interactive web design. It is an ideal project for portfolios or academic submissions, showcasing proficiency in full-stack web development principles, real-time data handling, and modern UI/UX practices.
